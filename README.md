# Environeers

Environeers is a website focusing on increasing everyday actions that help the environment in big ways. Users of Environeers will become pioneers of environmentalism â€” hence the name. By becoming an Environeer, you tell us that you're committed to keeping our earth healthy for future generations.

Environeers was created by four college students:

- Abigail Thomas, freshman at UT Dallas
- Anjelica Avorque, junior at UT Dallas
- Khoa Vu, sophomore at UT Austin
- Tabreek Somani, sophomore at University of British Columbia

We hope that our website can inspire others to go out and perform small actions to make a big difference.

This project was created for Freetail Hacker's 2021 Learn-a-thon.
