# Environeers

Environeers is a website focusing on increasing everyday actions that help the environment in big ways. Users of Environeers will become pioneers of environmentalism â€” hence the name. By becoming an Environeer, you tell us that you're committed to keeping our earth healthy for future generations.

Environeers was created by four college students:

- [Abigail Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abigailthomas2020/), freshman at UT Dallas
- [Anjelica Avorque](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anjelica-avorque/), junior at UT Dallas
- [Khoa Vu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khoa-vu-0020141a8/), sophomore at UT Austin
- [Tabreek Somani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tabreeksomani/), sophomore at University of British Columbia

We hope that our website can inspire others to go out and perform small actions to make a big difference.

This project was created for Freetail Hacker's 2021 Learn-a-thon.
